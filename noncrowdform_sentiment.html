  	<p> <span class="excerpt"> 2. I don’t know what I expected, but it was nothing like what I found. Two ancient lamps burned fish oil, throwing dim shadows against the dark stone walls. There were six cots in the room, all occupied. Two children that were hardly more than babies shared a blanket on the stone floor, and another was curled up in a pile of rags. A boy my age sat in a dark corner, his head pressed against the wall. </span><br>

I thought that we would also be by each other’s side through good times and bad times. If I can’t trust her, then who can I trust? I just feel so hopeless and lost. </span><br>
